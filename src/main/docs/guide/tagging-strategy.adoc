= Tagging Strategy =

To deploy a new version of a microservice you will need to bump up the version number and push a GIT tag with the following structure `{servicename}-{versionnumber}`.

*Bump up the version number*

For example, to deploy version 0.12 of the `opes-gateway` service, you will need to edit `opes-gateway/gradle.properties` and set
the `projectVersion` property to 0.12 and also edit `opes-gateway/opes-dispatch-deployment.yml` and set `opes-gateway-0.12` as the tag name.

[source, yaml]
----
..
.
         image: gcr.io/opes-one/opes-gateway:opes-gateway-0.12
..
.
----

For version 0.12 of `opes-gateway` the GIT tag will be `opes-gateway-0.12` Such tag triggers the deployment of the version 0.12 of `opes-gateway` microservice.

You need to create a https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/[Cloud Build Tag] trigger per microservice.

Next image illustrates an example trigger for the `opes-gateway` microservice:

NOTE: regular expression opes-gateway.* matches the a tag such as `opes-gateway-0.12`

WARNING: previous image uses https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/configuring-builds/substitute-variable-values[Cloud Build Substitutions] to expose the cluster name and region. Those need to match the actual values in the OPES project.

The previous GIT TAG trigger runs a Cloud build configuration file. In the case of the `opes-gateway` service such file looks like:

[source, yaml]
----
include::{sourcedir}opes-gateway/cloudbuild-deploy.yaml[]
----

The previous Cloud build configuration file:

- Run Gradle Task `build` which runs the tests.
- Builds a container image using https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib[Jib]. Jib enables to build your image directly to a Docker daemon. It uses the docker command line tool and requires that you have docker available on your PATH.
- Pushes the image to the https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/[Google Container Registry] tagging it with the version name.
- Deploy to Kubectl to GKE.

The last step uses a deployment file.

The `opes-gateway` deployment file is illustrated in the following snippet:

[source, yaml]
----
include::{sourcedir}opes-gateway/opes-gateway-deployment.yml[]
----

Please, note that the previous deployment descriptor uses the Config Map `opes-gateway-configmap` created before.
