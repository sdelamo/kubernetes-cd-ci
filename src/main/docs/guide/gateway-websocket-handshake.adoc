The initial handshake request must target `/nodes/{nodeName}` where the `nodeName` is one the node ids provided in the <<node-keys-sync, Node Keys Synchronization>> step. For example `/nodes/akorunska115`.

IMPORTANT: The node must provide a JWT prefixed by `Bearer ` in the HTTP Authorization header value.

- The signature of the JWT will be validated with one of the public keys provided in the  <<node-keys-sync, Node Keys Synchronization>> step.

- The expiration claim of the JWT will be validated as well.
