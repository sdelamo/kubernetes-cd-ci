Then connect via websockets to `ws://localhost:8080/nodes/akorunska115`

Once you are connected you will receive, the next message:

`{"msg":"connected"}`.

Please note `akorunska115` is a node name.

Refer to Network communication section below to learn more about the websocket messages. [TODO]

Note, if you did not disabled security you will need to supply a JWT token signed in websocket initial handshake which the gateway microservice can validate. The `gateway` microservice should be able to validate JWT signatures with the public keys exposed to the node registry.
