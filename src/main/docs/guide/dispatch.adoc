= Dispatch =

Inside the `opes-dispatch` service there is a Job  ( link:javadoc/opes-dispatch/com/opes/scoring/dispatch/PuzzleSchedulerJob.html[PuzzleSchedulerJob] ) which triggers the generation of puzzles for nodes which are currently not busy and dispatches those puzzles through the websocket connection the `opes-gateway` service.

|===
| Key | Default value | Description
| `opes.puzzle.scheduler.rate` |  2 minutes | frequency of execution
| `opes.puzzle.scheduler.delay` |  2 minutes | intial delay to be trigger
|===

WARNING: `PuzzleSchedulerJob` is only executed in the Kubernetes (k8s) environment.

The next diagram illustrates the dispatch flow:

NOTE: Communication between microservices is secured. Requests include a JWT prefixed by *Bearer _* as the value of the HTTP Authorization header. The dispatcher generates the JWT and signs it using a Secret Signature configuration. The secret, configurable through secret `opes.jwt.secret` - see <<secret, Kubernetes Secret>> section, is shared between the different microservices.

<1> The `opes-dispatcher` fetches the nodes ids in the `opes-registry` persistence.
<2> The `opes-dispatcher` asks the `puzzle-scorer` to get a list of busy nodes. The dispatcher will not send puzzles to busy nodes.
<3> The `opes-dispatcher` asks the `opes-puzzlegenerator` service to generate a Puzzle for every available node.
<4> Sends the puzzle to the `opes-gateway` service.
<5> The `opes-gateway` service dispatches the puzzle through the websocket session to the node.
<6> The `opes-gateway` notifies the `puzzle-scorer` service so that he can keep track of on-going puzzle-challenges.
